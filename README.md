### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sue & I am proud student :school_satchel: of SheCodes Australia, currently part of the 2022/2023 cohort, which includes over 20 women :woman: exploring the exciting world of coding and IT. Since my early days, I have had a passion for technology and have used VBA and HTML. 

In my current course, I am learning various languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, React, DRF, Restful APIs, JavaScript, and front-end deployment via Fly & Netlify. I am thrilled to be on this journey, and it has only just begun!

Growing up, I always enjoyed computers :computer:, but I thought I wasn't smart enough to fit into an industry dominated by men. However, I know that things are changing, and a balance of genders is crucial to better initiatives and decisions. 

Join me on my journey, and feel free to check out my projects. 

I welcome your feedback and suggestions as they are the only way we can improve.
