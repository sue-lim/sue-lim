### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Sue & I am a proud student :school_satchel: of SheCodes Australia, currently part of the 2022/2023 cohort. I'm also pursuing a certificate in programming, diving into the exciting world of coding and IT alongside over 20 women :woman: blazing a trail in this field. Since my early days, I've harbored a passion for technology and have dabbled in VBA and HTML.

In my ongoing coursework, I'm delving into various programming languages like HTML, CSS, Python, React, DRF, Restful APIs, JavaScript, and mastering front-end deployment via Fly & Netlify. This journey has just kicked off, and I couldn't be more thrilled!

While growing up, my love for computers :computer: was strong, but I once believed I might not be suited for an industry predominantly led by men. Thankfully, times are changing, and I firmly believe a diverse gender balance is essential for driving innovative initiatives and making informed decisions.

Come along on this journey with me, and feel free to explore my projects. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable in my quest for improvement.
